Master's Thesis: Analysis of Food Safety Notifications from RASFF

Project Overview
This repository contains the Python code used for web scraping the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) portal. The scraping was conducted to gather data spanning from 2020 to 2024 as part of my Master's thesis in food safety management. 
The purpose of this project is to analyze trends and patterns in food safety notifications to better understand the distribution and prevalence of various hazards across different countries and product categories.

Thesis Background
The thesis aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of food safety incidents reported through the RASFF portal, identifying key trends and geographical variations in notification frequency and response measures. 
By employing advanced data scraping techniques alongside business intelligence tools, the study offers insights into the dynamics of food safety management across Europe. The findings are intended to help improve food safety standards and 
practices by informing policy and facilitating international collaboration.

Repository Contents
Web Scraping Code: Python scripts used to extract data from the RASFF portal. The scripts demonstrate how to programmatically access and retrieve structured data from publicly available sources. This code is essential for researchers 
looking to perform similar analyses or to expand on the current study.

Data and Privacy
No scraped data is uploaded in this repository due to potential privacy and data usage concerns associated with sharing scraped datasets. Researchers interested in replicating the study or exploring the data further should scrape their 
data directly from the RASFF portal using the provided scripts, ensuring compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

Academic Purpose
This work is strictly for academic purposes, forming a part of my Master's degree requirement. It is intended to contribute to academic discussions and advancements within the field of food safety management.
